# Tools_And_Grinding_ERP

Main goal of this project is to provide functionality needed by a typical tools and grinding shop. 
Original client operates in the USA (specifically California) and their business is used as template for the project.
The original client used an ERP software that was supposed to be tailored to their needs. However, the software was found to be lacking in features and functionalities that would make it truly useful leaving the client unsatisfied and lacking proper tools.
Ultimate goal of this project is to build usable software that would be useful to the original client and cover all their recognized needs and requirements. From that point the software may be further amended or redesigned to be useful to other businesses in the same industry or potentially different ones.
Task of buiding the software will be done in steps. Below is a list of features to be worked upon. If possible the list will recognize priorites and move them to the top.

Recognized functionalites list:
1. Scheduling.
2. Job planning.
3. Client quotation.


Ad. 1.
This point will tie into point 2 so they might be combined in the future, however for the moment they will be treated separately. Scheduling should be focused on providing a potential delivery date upon creating a quotation based on order of material, workforce and machine availability.

Ad. 2.
Job planning is mostly concerned with the machines and their operators. It should calculate how long it will take to perform a specific task with a given set of parameters such as personnel, machine and resource availability.

Ad. 3.
There is a need to create a better tool for calculating quotes for the clients that will take note of all the potential costs. 

As it stands the key components for all three are as follows:
- The machine - it's capabilities, the processes (operable axes, tools) it can run and the time needed to complete them.
- The machinist.
- The material.
