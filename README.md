# Tools_And_Grinding_ERP

Main goal of this project is to provide functionality needed by a typical tools and grinding shop. 
Original client operates in the USA (specifically California) and their business is used as template for the project.
The original client used an ERP software that was supposed to be tailored to their needs. However, the software was found to be lacking in features and functionalities that would make it truly useful leaving the client unsatisfied and lacking proper tools.
Ultimate goal of this project is to build usable software that would be useful to the original client and cover all their recognized needs and requirements. From that point the software may be further amended or redesigned to be useful to other businesses in the same industry or potentially different ones.
Task of buiding the software will be done in steps. Below is a list of features to be worked upon. If possible the list will recognize priorites and move them to the top.

Recognized functionalites list:
1. Scheduling.
2. Job planning.
3. Client quotation.
