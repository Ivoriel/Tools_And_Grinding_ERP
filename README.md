# Tools_And_Grinding_ERP

Main goal of this project is to provide functionality needed by a typical tools and grinding shop. 
Original client operates in the USA (specifically California) and their business is used as template for the project.
The original client used an ERP software that was supposed to be tailored to their needs. However, the software was found to be lacking in features and functionalities that would make it truly useful leaving the client unsatisfied and lacking proper tools.
